# redstone-armor-and-tools
Mod that adds Redstone armor and tools.

Boredom is wack, so i decided to make armor and tools made out of Redstone in MCreator just out of spite for modding gatekeepers.

### Adds:

• Redstone Sword

• Redstone Axe

• Redstone Pickaxe

• Redstone Shovel

• Redstone Hoe

• Redstone Helmet

• Redstone Chestplate

• Redstone Leggings

• Redstone Boots

### Features:

• Armor is planned to react with Redstone when the hitboxes touch each other (Planned for future updates)

• Redstone items are planned to be created by upgrading Iron Tools & Armor with Redstone on a Smithing Table (As such the mod is limited to 1.16+ until someone finds/makes a mod that backports the smithing table to previous versions.)
